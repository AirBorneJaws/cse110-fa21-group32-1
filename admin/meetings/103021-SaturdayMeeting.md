Suggestions for app name

### Reviewing slides

- Later in meeting will decide a priority list for features to implement
- To clarify "No Go's" are things we will definately not implement
- Rabbit Holes are things we should be wary of when implementing as they may take a lot of time
- We should try add more things to the Rabbit hole slide
- Wire frames still need to be finalised 
- Create flowchart basd off of finalised wireframes
- Eamon suggest using Flask as well as using local database.
- We can add more to the presentation but we have minimum.
