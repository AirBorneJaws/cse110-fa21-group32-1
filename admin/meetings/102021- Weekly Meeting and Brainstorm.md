## Today's Topics
1. **Research on other websites**
  - First of all, we go through all the webistes that team members find. We compare each website and find the commons and differences between them.
2. **General features of the app**
  - Meal Calender: we think that most people use recipe app is aiming to prepare their own meal. In this way, it is common that people will try to set up multiple meals instead of one
  at once. Hence, meal calender will be necessary since it allows users to design their meal plan clearly. Therefore, users should able to edit, add or delete their calender consequently.
3. **Explore**
  - undoubtly, this is one of the most important features that the app must contain. Since almost every user will use explore feature, how to make search convininet is important.
  We decide that users should able to search through these ways:
  - 1. List items with highest average ratings
  - 2. tags
  - 3. own recipes
  - 4. similar recipes
  - 5. diet, allergies,style, ingredient etc.
4. **Create and modify recipe**
  - another important feature is that modify recipe. Since most users would like to share their recipes or follow other users' recipes, our app should allow users to create and modify
  their own recipes. Moreover, users should be able to follow a specific user's account so that if he/she post something new, followers can get the notifications instantly.
5. **User Account**
  - In order to fulfill the previous feature, we will also include user account in the app. Beyond than just make users can follow each other, user account page is also a private place
  only for users themselves. In this page, users can modify their personal information, settings and check everything they have added to their favorites etc.
6. **Other features**
  - Grocery List: there are still problems with this as is this really necessary and feasible
  - Randomizer: For users who do not have specific target or preference, randomizer will show all recipes randomly so that users may find something they are interested in.
7. **General outlook of app**
  - We believe that less buttons on the app will make it better since no users would like to see a page with many buttons and trying to figure them out one by one.
  In this way, we decide that at the top of the page should be a search bar in the middle with a drop down menu to its left. And at the bottom part should be three buttons for recipe, calender and account.
8. **recipe page**
  - So for recipe page, we talk about that it should consist of pictures, describtions and might also contains a feature that allows users to zoom on each step since users might use the app
  and cook at the same time which means that it might make easier for users to cook if they can focus on each step.

## Future plans
