## Today's topic
1. Group Contract
   - Talk about the content of Group Contract. Everyone satisfies with the rules about responsibilities and punishment of violations. Reminder: Finish reading and signing at the bottom of the contract before **10/13/2021 11:59pm**.
2. Dividing Group
   - Due to the multiple assignments, we decide to divide team into two subgroups: one works on designing team logo, brand, theme power point, team page and another team makes intro video. The reason for dividing group is because it is inefficient and messy for the whole group members to work on single assignment simultaneously. Dividing group can also ensure everyone participates into the assignment.
   - Intro Video Group: Esther, Bargrat, Stewart and Martin
   - Team Page Group: Hannah, Tiffany, Ke, Duc, You, Eamon and George.
   - If it is necessary, Team Page group can itself decides who work on designing logo/brand etc.
3. Bonding Event
   - We will use or regular meeting time **Wed 9:30pm - 10:30pm** for bonding activity. Also, we will check the progress of each subgroup and help each other if there is anyone having problems. We choose this time because it guarantees that most of us can attend the bonding activity.
4. What need to be done tomorrow night before **11:59pm Oct.12**:
   - 10 sec personal introduction video (Your name, and something about you)
   - picture, name, Github page link, and a brief summary about you (one or two sentences).
   - Create a folder under your name and upload videos and other information there.
   - Team Logo ideas (Team name: Aces).Share your thoughts in discussion(Slack).

## Future plans

3. Brainstorm what app should we build. what things do we need? What elements should include in the app?
