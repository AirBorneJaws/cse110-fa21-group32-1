## Summary
We are setting up management tools on the backend, so we assigned different assignments for members to do for research. We are going to divide tasks, try unit testing, make customer tags, prototyping, etc.

## Future Plan:
1. Finished up assignments that we assign to each small group and checked others' work if they need help.
2. Test out with which backend tools are better for the long run
3. Follow up the planned schedule.
4. Join office hours that Professor Powell can remember us!
