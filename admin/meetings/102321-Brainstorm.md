## Today's Topics
1. **Overall Proceducres**
- We first take a look at all later assignments such as Project pitch, road map etc.
2. **Targeted users**
- It is impossible for our app to fit for all users. In this way, we decide that our app should aim on those users who have little money and time
which means people who try to learn recipe at a relatively low cost. In this way, we decide to narrow down our user personas into at most three
or four categories. **Martin, Tiffany, Stuart** will be responsible for this.
3. **Notification**
- Another problem is that where should users see their subscirptions? And how often should notifications pop up since we need to consider how often
users will check notifications. Considering all these problems, we currently think that we can have a drop down section for subscribers. 
So users can click on and it will directly redirect to that person's page. Below that section, we could also maybe have a favorite section. 
Everything you liked, saved, checked and makred will show here.
4. **Recipe Page**
- So for recipe page, we plan to include these features:
  1. Picture of final results
	2. ingredients
	3. steps
	4. Cooking/prep time
	5. Servings
	6. Ratings
	7. reviews
	8. Save to favorites
	9. Author of recipe/subscribe
	10. Cooking mode
	11. Nutriton Facts
  
 However, there are few problems:
 1. **length**
 - As we discussed before, a clean page will make users feel more comfortable. If we indeed include all these details, it would make
 the page pretty long and users have to scroll back and forth which is inconvinient. In this way, we decide to make different sections
 such as: **Summary, Ingredients, Steps, Reviews**:
   1. Summary:
      1. Picture of results
      2. dollar sign for general idea of how much a meal is ($,$$,$$$)
      3. ratings
      4. cooking/prep time
      5. serving
      6. tags(do we really need this?)
      
    For tags, some members believe that it is necessary since users might look at them for a general idea of the meal. While
    others point out that too many tags might makes the page look aimless. Also, should users be able to customize the tagsa?
    If yes, how should we make that all tags are valid? If not, how should we decide tags?
    
    2. Ingredients:
       1. auto-claculate-serving
       2. picture
    
    3. Steps:
       1. steps
       2. cooking mode option
       
    4. Reviews:
       1. pictures
       2. comments
   
2. **Nutrition Fact**
- This is also a big problem. If we decide to include nutrition fact, should it be precise or vague? If it is precise, how can we know the accurate data for each meal? If vague, 
how vague should it be so that it still provides a general idea to users while not useless? And how often people will check nutriton fact? If most people do not care about nutrition,
it would be meaningless to include such information on the page.

## Future plan:
1. Solve all those unsolved problems above
2. Design flow
3. Genral outlook of how the app will run.
4. Later Assignments
