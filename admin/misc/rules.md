  - All members should be mindful to make good use of designated meeting time and try their best to end on time, in order to respect other people’s schedules. If a meeting should run over, team members that have to leave can check the minutes and/or it can be continued at a later time/online.

- All team members are responsible for the group's project and should put their best effort.

## **5. Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines**
- Team leaders are responsible for conveying information correctly from the mentor to all team members.
- Team leaders must assign tasks to all team members equally and leave enough time for team members to finish.
- Team leaders and team members should not blame any team member but instead offer help and encouragement.

## **6. Conflict Resolution**
- If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to take the consequence collectively to address the problem before bringing the issue to TA and Professor.
- If there is conflict between team members, team leaders should make decisions based on the majority's ideas.
